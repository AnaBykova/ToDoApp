In this TODO application, we will watch how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, 
implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

Step1
Begin by accessing the task-form, confirm-close-dialog, and open-task-form-btn elements with the getElementById() method. 
Save them in the variables taskForm, confirmCloseDialog, and openTaskFormBtn.
